## RELEASE-1

### In this release, we are showing the self-study and learning tasks we have done for the client in the last 2 months. The first month was used for learning about the client's app and the development tools needed for future tasks. We were assigned 3 tasks over the course of next month and each of us had to do them individually. The tasks were to create basic flutter apps to help us in getting familiarised with dart programming language as well as the android studio IDE. The submitted code has been contributed by the team members.
<br>

> For each task, we have submitted the lib folder, containing the main.dart file as well as the multiple pages of the app (task-3), along with the pubsec.yaml file and the assets used like images. The other files used in the apps are common to all.

> Task-1:
  Made a Hello World app in Flutter with an navbar,image and a button, which when clicked, shows an alert and a message.

> Task-2:
  Made a flutter app with a text input field, allowing users to enter text and converting it into speech on press of submit button. Implemented using flutter_tts package. Implemented speech output in local languages like Hindi and Telugu as well as English. 

> Task-3:
  Made a flutter app with multiple navigatable screens and vehicle options on a particular screen which announces vehicle information on clicking along with a pop-up/alert for the vehicle.

> Task-4:
  Extension of task-3. Used JSON data provided by client to output notifications as speech.
  
> Task-5:
  Created the UI for home page for client's app and implemented text to speech feature which outputs the amount of fuel theft for the last week and month on opening the page.


## RELEASE-2

### In this release, we added more features like dashboard, maps and speech to text functionality. We then integrated all the features and tested the app. The submitted code has been contributed by the team members.

> Created a dashboard with text to speech announcement of fuel theft statistics

> Add map with live tracking simulation using python script connected to firebase.

> Created a login form with speech to text functionality.

> Integrated all the implemented features.

> Thoroughly tested the app on multiple devices.

### The files included in the Final code folder include all folders necessary to run the app except for the build, android and ios folders which contain code that has not been changed after creating the project, except for the AndroidManifest.xml file which needs to replace the standard one.

### The app is specificly made for Android devices, which is the current platform for the existing client app.
